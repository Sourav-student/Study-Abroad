      <p class="box hidden">
        One of the biggest advantages of studying MBBS abroad is the low cost of education. The fees for MBBS in India
        can range from 15 lakhs to 80 lakhs per year, depending on the college and the quota. This makes it unaffordable
        for many students who belong to middle-class or lower-class families. Moreover, there are other expenses
        involved such as hostel fees, mess fees, books, stationery, etc.

        <span class="text-2xl cursor-pointer more">+</span>
      </li>
      <p class="box hidden">
        Institutes that are recognised by the MCI and also meet the local standard of education regulations generally
        offer top quality education to MBBS students. As compared to domestic institutes, medical colleges abroad face
        extensive censure to maintain quality standards. However, it‚Äôs best to verify the ranking and/or reviews of any
        institution you are considering applying to.
      </p>
      <li class="bg-white p-4 rounded-lg shadow-md flex justify-between">
        <span>No entrance exam</span>
        <span class="text-2xl cursor-pointer more">+</span>
      </li>
      <p class="box hidden">
        Unlike some Indian medical colleges that require students to clear challenging entrance exams, most Russian
        universities offer direct admission to MBBS courses. This eliminates the stress of entrance exams and provides a
        straightforward application process. However, to study MBBS Abroad or MBBS in Russia, Indian students must
        qualify NEET to be able to practice medicine in India after completing an MBBS course from a recognized medical
        university Abroad.
