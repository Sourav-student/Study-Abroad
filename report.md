# Study MBBS Abroad - Landing Page Development Report

## Introduction
The "Study MBBS Abroad" landing page was developed as part of the Front-End Development Intern application for University Insights. The objective was to create a responsive, visually appealing, and SEO-optimized landing page to promote MBBS programs in various countries. The page includes key sections such as program details, top destinations, admission processes, and a lead generation form.

## Design and Development Approach

### UI/UX Considerations
The landing page was designed with a clean and professional look, ensuring a seamless user experience across different devices. Key design choices include:
- **Minimalist Design:** Focus on readability and ease of navigation.
- **Mobile-First Approach:** Optimized for smartphones and tablets.
- **Clear CTAs:** Buttons and forms are prominently placed for easy interaction.

### Technologies Used
The project utilized modern front-end and back-end technologies to achieve responsiveness and performance:
- **HTML5** for structuring the content.
- **Tailwind CSS** for efficient styling and responsiveness.
- **JavaScript** for form validation and interactive elements.
- **Google Analytics** for performance tracking.
- **Node.js + Express** for backend form processing.
- **Render.com** for backend deployment.

## Key Features Implemented

### Responsive Hero Section
The hero section includes a compelling headline and a Call-to-Action (CTA) button that links to the lead generation form.

### Top Countries & Admission Process
A well-structured grid displays the top MBBS destinations, ensuring users can easily scan through the options. The admission process is outlined step by step to provide clarity.

### Lead Generation Form
The form captures user details (name, email, phone number, and country preference) and includes real-time validation using JavaScript. The form submits data to a **Node.js backend** hosted on Render, which stores the data in **MongoDB Atlas**.

### SEO Optimization
- **Meta Tags:** Title, description, and keywords for search visibility.
- **Structured Headings:** `<h1>`, `<h2>`, and `<h3>` used correctly for better indexing.

### Performance Tracking
Google Analytics and Facebook Pixel were integrated to track user activity and optimize marketing efforts.

## Deployment & Hosting
The project was deployed using **Vercel** for the frontend and **Render** for the backend.
